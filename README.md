the issue:
the user logs in, but user_id never registered with project

The flow I am intending:

1. the user logins in with their google account.
2. project.py will examine account, if new account then new user will be created, otherwise sign in existing user
3. newly loggin in user will then proceed to utilize the site with appropriate editing/deleting privalges.
